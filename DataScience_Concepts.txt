Data Science: Thank you Ramisha Rani for the awesome session :)
    study about statistics
    Exploratory Data analysis = Descriptive + Inferential    
    Eg: Ice cream bar- gender, category of ice cream sold-> How can we improve the business with the given data
    
Application:
    Binomial Probability-> Quality assurance of 1000 products-> Sampling inspection 100 products if 920 good and 80 bad then 92% good quality

Key Terms:
1. Population: all the values of the column
2. Sample: Properties of population
3. Statistic: Finding the value for sample dataset
4. Parameter: statistic which gives value for the population
5. Variable: No. of doctors who have been involved in one or more reaserch paper

Eg: Vel Tech M1 average score 1000 students
    Take one section average and same applicable to entire college
    
    Fair & Lovely
    Done reaserch for all color with some people in each category and they are advertising this is applicable for same color people
    
Exploratory Data analysis:
1. Univariate Data- one variable- Mean, average Eg: average of XII Marks
2. Bivariate Data- two variable- cause and effect relationship Eg: Happiness and quality of life
3. Multivariate Data- more than two variables- cause and effect of all variables

Datatype:
int 1 2 4 8
float 2.1 4.7 11.9 13.97
string "Ramisha Rani" "Karthick"

Logic:
age- int
salary- float
gender- object

if(column.datatype==object):
    print(Qual)
else:
    print(Quan)
    
Central Tendency:
1. Mean: average of marks scored by ECE Department - How much petrol needed to travel from A to B
2. Median: midpoint of data
    total count
    ascending order
    odd->[(n+1)/2]th postion, even-> n/2, average of(n/2, n+1/2) value
3. Mode: most repeated data point- Face detection of employees- Attendance

Frequency:
    How many students have spent 2 hrs daily for AI 
Relative frequency:
    Frequency/100
Cumulative relative frequency:
    summation
    

Percentage Vs Percentile:
Percentage: Naveen scored 99% in XII examination
Percentile: in which range people are standing

dataset.isnull().sum()
dataset.isna().sum() //To calculate null or empty values

IQR(Interquartile Range):
    To know the outlier range present in the dataset
    IQR=Q3-Q1
    Lesser outlier= Q1-1.5IQR not lesser than this value
    Greater outlier=Q3+1.5IQR not greater than this value
